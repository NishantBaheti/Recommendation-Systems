    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike collaborative filtering, content-based filtering doesn’t need extensive data from other users to create recommendations. Once a user has searched on and browsed a few items and/or completed some purchases, a content-based filtering system can begin making relevant recommendations.\n",
    "- Content-based recommenders can be highly tailored to the user’s interests, including recommendations for niche items, because the method relies on matching the characteristics or attributes of a database object with the `user’s profile`. \n",
    "- Recommendations are transparent to the user. Highly relevant recommendations project a sense of openness to the user, bolstering their trust level in offered recommendations. Comparatively, with collaborative filtering, instances are more likely to occur where users don’t understand why they see specific recommendations. For example, let’s say a group of users who purchased an umbrella also happen to buy down puffer coats. A collaborative system may recommend down puffer coats to other users who bought umbrellas but are uninterested in and have never browsed or purchased that product.\n",
    "- You avoid the “cold start” problem. Collaborative filtering creates a potential cold start scenario when a new website or community has few new users and lacks user connections. Although content-based filtering needs some initial inputs from users to start making recommendations, the quality of early recommendations is generally better than a collaborative system that requires the addition and correlation of millions of data points before becoming optimized."

    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " For example, recommending news articles based on news browsing is useful. Still, it would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions, etc., from different services, can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system\n",
